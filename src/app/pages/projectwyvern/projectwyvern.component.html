  <div class="contents">
    <p>While video games are one of the largest entertainment industries in the world, they are still largely unaccessible. Project Wyvern is based on creating more accessible gaming for those with limited bodily function and focused around those with exclusive control of their head. </p>

    <p>The idea is that with a simply sip-and-puff controller, those limited to head and neck movement would be able to game! While there exists controllers like this, they are complicated and expensive. This project will focus on developing a game that is based around a simple device that is essentially a single analogue stick with a tube attached. Players use this tube to position the stick, and can suck (sip) or blow (puff) the tub to also give input.</p>

  </ul>

  <p>After reading the abstracts for these articles I chose five to do a deeper dive into. I read through the articles to get a general idea and below have written my major takeaways as a quick summary.</p>

  <p><strong>Game Not Over: Accessibility Issues in Video Games </strong></p>

  <p>How games are inaccessible for different people, and what important factors play into these issues, such as story, relying on audio cues, lack of tutorial, and overly complex controls. The solution lies in options for text to speech, speech to text, menu narration, and clear, simple, repeatable tutorials.</p>

  <p><strong>More Than Just a Game: Accessibility in Computer Games </strong></p>

  <p>Accessibility is important in gaming to give people access to social outlets, educational tools, and entertainment. Improving accessibility in one of the largest entertainment industries is important to make sure those with disabilities do not feel like they are treated unfairly by society, and giving them equal opportunities. Addressing why it isn't enough to just say some games are just supposed to be hard, like Dark Souls, and see how the effort to be inclusive is important.</p>

  <p><strong>Game Accessibility and Advocacy for Participation of the Japanese Disability Community</strong></p>

  <p>Japan's treatment of video games is not the same as other forms of entertainment. The lack of political efforts to support accessible gaming. Talk about how the issue is gaining traction, especially around the idea of including an easy mode or something similar to make sure the game is accessible. Efforts like these are moving video games towards a more commonly accepted form of entertainment like film, tv, and literature.</p>

  <p><strong>Design of a Curriculum Framework for Raising Awareness of Game Accessibility</strong></p>

  <p>There wasn’t a requirement for accessibility in consoles until 2015. Since this is so recent, most developers have not had the consideration of accessibility included in any part of their education or career experience. Discusses importance of accessibility to unskilled and older gamers. This delay is the reason we are missing emphasis of inclusivity in education of game dev because it was being pushed to the side. Now that it is a requirement there should be a big increase in accessibility in new generations of gaming.</p>

  <p><strong>Using Ants’ Task Division for Better Game Engines – A Contribution to Game Accessibility for Impaired Players</strong></p>

  <p>Level problems, or lack of accessibility due to difficulty, are more common than interactive problems. By creating an adaptive game (specifically enemies) based off of player actions/ability, the game becomes more accessible. This is a huge part of accessibility that is not initially considered but makes a massive difference in the accessibility of the game.</p>

  <h3>What is the market?</h3>

  <p>After learning more on what research is being done on accessibility in gaming I looked towards what market my research would fall under. This would address a global market and would fall under the art, entertainment, and recreation sectors as it is a video game. It could additionally address the educational sector because of the potential for gaming to be used educationally, and lastly fits under the health care and social assistance sector as it is focused on improving quality of life for those with limiting disabilities. These are massive markets, in the US alone these sectors see around $1.4 trillion in annual sales. Globally would be even larger. While this project is focused specifically on those looking for accessibility options in gaming, it still fits into the overall gaming spectrum. There are plently of big players in these markets, but ones that fall in line with my research are large gaming companies.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Ubisoft, worth around 12.8 billion. Ubisoft is a large gaming company with many popular brands like Assassins Creed, Just Dance, Far Cry, Watch Dogs, Tom Clancy Rainbow Six, and many more. They largely develop complex 3D action games.</li>
      <li>EA, worth around 35.1 billion. A massive game development company that covers all the bases, with a dominant control over sports games, but all producing series like Battlefield, The Sims, Plants vs Zombies, current Star Wars games, and many more.</li>
      <li>Nintendo, worth around 57.6 billion. Known across the globe as one of THE video game companies, Nintendo is commonly known as what every mom calls their kids gaming device. Active in the handheld market and focused on developing games for all ages (especially children), Nintendo makes games such as Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Mario, Metroid, and so many more.</li>
      <li>Sony, worth around 105 billion. The owner of the Playstation brand, Sony has exclusives like God of War, Uncharted, the new Spiderman games, Last of Us, and many others.</li>
      <li>Microsoft, worth around 1,770 billion. Microsoft owns Xbox, the main competitor to Playstation. Microsoft has recently been acquiring gaming studies, most likely to guarantee exclusives for their platform, as well as getting into the PC market. They own exclusives such as Halo and Gears of War, and recently acquired Bethesda, the studio who makes games like the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. They have recently made a large push for accessible gaming and released a special controller designed to accommodate all kinds of special tools to make gaming available to everyone.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As far as products in my market segment go it should cover all games! Unfortunately not all games make an effort to be accessible. I have found a few games from 2020 that made serious efforts to improve accessibility.</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Hyper Dot by Charles McGregor, small game developed with accessibility in mind. Through a research campaign Charles gathered information for what helps make a fun accessible game.</li>
      <li>Last of Us Part II developed my Naughty Dog included over 60 accessibility options to make the game available to all audiences, from colorblind filters to audio to text to auto aim.</li>
      <li>Immortals Fenyx Rising by Ubisoft had many different accessibility features, from difficulty levels to menu narration. The most notable feature was assistance with puzzles in game to make them more accessible.</li>
      <li>Gears Tactics by Microsoft Studios is an RTS, which are well known for their complex details and lengthy lists of stats. They included a “Let the game read to me” mode as well as text to speech functions and larger text to assist players.</li>
      <li>Spider Man: Miles Morales developed by Insomniac Games included a number of accessibility settings to make the game easier to see, and included things like chase assistance to make it easier for players to keep up. They also included a character who communicated with Miles exclusively through sign language, which is important because of the lack of representation in gaming for the disabled community.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Who is the audience?</h3>
  <p>Lastly I wanted to consider my audience. The audience for this research is those limited by the lack of accessibility in gaming. The idea of accessibility in gaming is growing as the gaming community as a whole grows, becoming one of the largest entertainment industries in the world. The audience ranges from everyday people who can work anywhere and do anything and have difficulty with their vision or hearing, ranging from older people to people with disabilities. It also focuses on those with mental or physical limitations. The audience ranges massively, from people working 40 hour weeks to those who will never be able to work much more than a few hours at a time. They face a number of challenges due to their limitations, and these challenges are often exasterbated by society’s lack of effort to make sure products and services are inclusive and accessible. My customers would value fun, accessible, and inclusive gaming that isn’t just designed for small audiences, but enjoyable for everyone. It is unrealistic to expect that my audience will have any resources beyond your average gamer, so the requirement for expensive equipment or custom software is unfair and unrealistic.</p>

    First Week of Prototyping
  </h2>
  <div class="date">
    2021-02-10
  </div>
  <div class="contents">
    <p>This week I spent my time testing a very simple dynamic difficulty system I created. I developed a simple game in Unity3D to start, and then began working on the dynamic difficutly.
    Obviously something like this could take years to develop a truly responsive AI, but I started by making a list of some simple factors that I believe affect a games difficulty.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Number of enemies</li>
        <li>Enemies health (resiliance to damage)</li>
        <li>Enemy damage to player</li>
        <li>Enemy weapons/types</li>
        <li>Reduce player damage output</li>
        <li>Reduce quality of items available to player</li>
        <li>Enemies reactions to player</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enemies reactions to the player can be a number of things, but I am focusing on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How smart they are/what strategy they follow</li>
        <li>How quick they move and react</li>
        <li>How they attack (moves and level of aggression)</li>
        <li>How they defend (moves and healing or escape strategies)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These things seemed like a good start. I began by focusing on adjusting how many enemies spawned as well as how much health they have. The better the player is doing, more enemies will begin to spawn with more health. As the player does worse less enemies will spawn with less health. The hard parts are balancing so there is a cap of difficulty (the game isn't unbeatable) and making sure the system isn't obviously adjusting to how the player is doing.</p>

    <p>Since I already knew I was facing a difficult task, I am still confident I can find a good subject to focus my efforts on. I enjoyed working on the dynamic difficulty and feel like with more time I can expand it into a much more complex system. I currently had a simple spawning system for enemies, and very simple level progression system, and a way to track statistics of the player from life to life. For example, I track how many enemies the player killed for the current life, and compare it to the number killed in the last life when they die. I do the same thing for the number of enemy spawners they completed, where the spawner is completed when all enemies spawned from it are dead. With these stats and a few others I was able to establish a rough idea of how well the player was doing, and able to lower the difficulty (the attack frequency and health of enemies) so that the player wouldn't constantly be stuck on the same spot.</p>

    <p>I used Unity3D and C# in my development. My plan for the coming week is to improve the dynamic difficulty system to see how much further I can go with it. I think a simple but effective system for self adjusting could do big things for accessibility in modern gaming. I could also see developing different features which I could enable to improve accessibility of the simple game I have created so far.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    Researching VR and Expanding on Dynamic Difficulty
  </h2>
  <div class="date">
    2021-02-17
  </div>
  <div class="contents"><p>This week while looking for alternate research topics I began considering the limitations of Virtual Reality to people with different disabilities. VR is designed the transport the player to a different world and immerse them in a different experience. For someone with a disability something like this would be a fantastic way to experience things they don't have the ability to in real life, but most VR controls are based around physical movement. Some games such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpPhz35c2qc&feature=youtu.be">Island 359</a> have made impressive strides to improve their accessibility, but still rely on the use of a controller. Another example is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1248360/WalkinVR/">WalkinVR</a> which is a steam product that can be used with Steam VR games to give the player a number of options to improve accessibility. Some examples are alternate controls for movement and rotation for people in wheelchairs, allowing another person to control some parts of the game with a different controller, hand tracking using the Kinect instead of controllers, and controller position adjustment for people who cannot move the controller to required positions on their own.</p>

    <p>Tools and implementations like these are all very cool, but still leave out people with extremely limited range of motion, specifically quadriplegics. Combined with some of these ideas above, I believe a sip-n-puff controller could be used to immerse people with a limited range of motion in VR games and worlds. With some tweaks to controls, a joystick could be used to both move the player and their vision. The sip-n-puff would give enough input to add variability into the game, and with additional assistance these simplified controls could make many VR games extremely accessible.</p>

    <p>In addition to my interest in VR accessibility this week I spent some time expanding on the dynamic difficulty technical expirements I did last week. I have created a fairly solid self balancing enemy system. It is based around how well the player has done in their past lives/attempts at the game. </p>

    <p>On the first island when a player starts the game they will fight 5 enemies.</p><img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/gifs217/normalguys.gif" alt="standard enemies"/>
    <br>

    <p>For some players this will be too easy, and they will quickly progress to the final island where there are 15 enemies to fight with the same attack speed, health, and movement speed of the first 5 enemies.</p><img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/gifs217/bigarmy.gif" alt="tons of enemies"/>
    <br>

    <p>Upon defeating all of the enemies in the first round of the game, it will restart, but this time we can see there is an additional enemy on the first island. They enemies also have increased movement speed and health.</p><img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/gifs217/hardguys.gif" alt="hard enemies"/>
    <br>

    <p>If the player instead lost multiple times in a row, we would see a decrease in the number of starting enemies. For this example I was defeated by enemies 5 times, and now only 3 enemies spawn on the first island.</p><img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/gifs217/easyguys.gif" alt="easy enemies"/>
    <br>

    <p>A simple system like this could greatly increase the accessibility of many games. While dynamic difficulty is specific to a game (FPS vs a puzzle game) the idea is not too hard to implement. The hard part is making it subtle, which my version is not.</p>

    Expanding VR Research
  </h2>
  <div class="date">
    2021-02-25
  </div>
  <div class="contents"><p>My research has progressed to now focus specifically on accessibility in VR. Virtual reality has the potential to transport users to different worlds in a more immersive way than was ever available before. However, it faces some massive accessibility issues. A few that I have identified that I spent my time researching this week were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Height difference-When the player's head is not positioned at the average standing height, whether they are sitting for shorter. This will affect their ability to interact with the envronment as things are positioned in the wrong place relative to the players view.</li>
        <li>Turning-Not all players can easily rotate 360 degrees while in game. Some have limitations that prevent them from spinning their body while playing.</li>
        <li>Maneuverability-Some players can't easily bend over of reach far from where they currently are, limiting what items, buttons, or other things they can reach in game.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to these more VR specific issues, we have our typical accessibility issues in video games. A few big ones are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Menu narration</li>
        <li>Subtitles</li>
        <li>Larger text</li>
        <li>Colorblind filters</li>
        <li>Audio adjustment</li>
        <li>Difficulty</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My plan is to start working on the specific VR issues first, as the gaming industry has began to work on integrating these other accessibility options into most games. My goal is to find a way to make virtual reality accessible to quadreplegic people, in the hope that it gives them an opportunity to experience other worlds just by putting on the headset.</p>

    <p>Next week I will begin technical work to actually implement these tools. For this week I have spent my time researching existing VR games and tools that include accessibility settings. First is <em>Island 359</em> which features height adjustment settings as well as reach to grab settings. The reach to grab is especially interestings, providing a useful way for the player to reach toward an object on the ground that is out of reach and it will fly to their hand. 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpPhz35c2qc&feature=youtu.be">Island 359 accessibility settings</a></p>
    <p>Video Games like <em>Hover Junkers, Space Pirate Trainer,</em> and <em>Job Simulator</em> offer options to raise view height for accessibility.
    <img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/jobSimSmallHuman.jpg" alt="small human switch"/></p>
    <p>Some games like <em>Unseen Diplomacy</em> offer different gameplay based off of players movement ability. Since <em>Unseen Diplomacy</em> is a game based on puzzles and players movement around them, the player can choose a seated mode that removes puzzles requiring the player to crouch or jump, which still offers the player a great experience without them even knowing it has been adjusted to be accessible to their playstyle. Another important thing to avoid to improve accessibility in VR is large amounts of crouching or bending over, since older players or those seated will not be able to complete the action. Controls like the <em>Island 359</em> option of reach to grab help limit this to specifically a movement issue.</p>

    <p>I intend to focus on a seated mode for VR, which would include height adjustment, reach to grab, and alternative turning methods (like bumper turning). Additionally I hope to create a new system for viewing the VR world that requires only the use of the players head. When looking far enough right or left, the camera could slowly pan so that a seated player does not need to spin. Similarly a joystick could be positioned below the players chin or controlled with their mouth to add movement in all 4 directions. By holding down on the joystick long enough the player could automatically spin 180 degrees. Control adjustments like these could make VR much more accessible for so many people. As far as input goes, I have mentioned a sip-n-puff device being used in the past. While I may not have access, theoretically two button presses could be mapped to sip-n-puff input (one for sip, one for puff). I will begin working from this angle and see where my research takes me.</p>

    <p>This was an exciting week because I finally feel like I am on track for my final project! The university has let me borrow a Oculus Rift CV1 headset to work with for my research, so this weekend I did a bit of research by playing a few VR games. There seems to be 4 types of movement systems in the games I played.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Teleportation:</b> This is common as a way to move around the world where you need to complete tasks where you will stay in a generally small area before moving to another location to complete some task. This is common in puzzle games, but can be seen in Valves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Nj1lYyQmI">Half-Life Alyx</a>.</li>
        <li><b>On rails or stationary:</b> Many games build the VR world so that either you are "on rails" meaining you do not control the player movement through the world, instead you travel a predetermined path. Other games take a similar approach where the player is expected to remain in place for the game, generally staying in the same small area. A good example of stationary is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lqsq4InjHk">the Vader Immortal dojo level</a> where you stand on a pad and fight waves of enemies. Arguably the most popular VR game is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V7ZUZVo0wg">Beat Saber</a> which is an on rails game. Both of these allow for fast paced action but make the game feel limited because of your lack of control</li>
        <li><b>Analog stick:</b> Similar to many standard games, your body is moved using the analogue sticks on the controllers. There are also games where you are operating a vehicle that allow you to move your body around. The games were fun but could sometimes be disorienting because of the visual appearance of moving forward, but you can feel that your body is actually standing still. One of them actually make me feel motion sick for a while. While the primary form of movement is probably expected to be swinging from webs, <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/2190323657748572/">Spider-Man: Far from Home Virtual Reality</a> does use a analogue stick movement system when you are on the ground.</li>
        <li><b>Lock and swing:</b> This was a very unique control system which required the player to reach forward and press and hold a button, and when you swing your arm backwards you essentially pull your body with your hand staying locked in place. This can be chained together to create something like a running motion, which is how they are used in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/578620/GORN/">Gorn</a>. These control systems are very cool and unique to VR, but not always easy to control and inaccessible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since the movement system is the first thing I wanted to address I spent some time experimenting with each on. After this I started by completing <a href="https://learn.unity.com/project/vr-beginner-the-escape-room">this project</a> provided by Unity as a tutorial for how to work with VR in Unity.
    I started by working on a seated mode for VR. As I've mentioned before, since VR positions your head where your VR headset is, if you are seated you are below the expected height for a user.</p>

    <p>For example, here is me raising the headset from my feet to above my head, then lowering it back down.</p>
    <img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/gifs3_3/standard.gif" alt="head moving gif"/>

    <p>Now this is me doing the same motion with seated mode enabled.</p>
    <img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/gifs3_3/seated.gif" alt="head moving gif"/>

    <p>As you can see the view of the player stays at a locked height so that they can still see over the obstacle in front of them. This is great for people who will not have their head positioned at the expected height of a player while playing.</p>

    <p>At this point I am midway through a system for rotating the player in game. Currently you can push the analogue sticks left or right to rotate the player a few degrees in that direction, but I am expirementing with a way where the user can just rotate their head to the side and the in game player will begin to rotate that direction. Right now it will only work for a second and then freeze because of an issue with understanding where the player is centered, but with more time that should be correctable! After that my goal will be to develop a simple system to let the player freely move around the area without physically moving, specifically where it could be operated exclusively by a users head.</p>

    Snap Turning without Controllers

    <p>This week I have a first version of Project Wyvern available for download! You can download the zip file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1151ff8jbSnSSvkDtAK8aLNKowPrcEflL/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. It has a simple menu and the option to enable seated mode before loading in. The level is a simple prototype with some teleportation pads and 2 interactable mugs.</p>

    <p>The level has 2 interactable mugs and 3 teleport pads which the player can move between. The player can walk around their space in real life and also move within the game. They can sit down or stand to raise or lower their perspective.</p>

    <img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/gifs3_10/standardMode.gif" alt="looking around the level"/>

    <p>When seated mode is enabled, the height and position of the player perspective is locked. The way it is currently implemented does not actually make the player taller, it just locks the perspective. This next week I'll be working on instead making the player taller while maintaining there ability to move within the game space. Additionally in seated mode there are 2 floating panels slight above and to the sides of the player. If the player looks directly at them long enough they will turn red and then rotate the player in that direction. This gives a seated player the ability to rotate without using their hands or moving in the real world. My intial attempts to design these controls were based strictly on how far to the side the player looked, but it turned out to be much easier to instead have a specific point the player should look at so that rotating is an active choice like pressing a button on a controller. Using a raycast out of the front of the player camera so when you look straight at the floating panel it registers that the player is looking at the panel and wants to turn.</p>

    <img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/gifs3_10/seatedMode.gif" alt="looking around using seated mode"/>

    <p>My next week of development is going to be focused on improving my seated mode perspective lock as well as developing a teleportation system for seated players. I have a few ideas on what kind of ways the player can control the game, so I may try to implement a few so that there are multiple options. Right now I am planning on developing a way there a chin mounted analogue stick could be used to teleport the player as well a similar system to the snap turning where you look at an object in game to move yourself. My current issue with both of these implementations have been making an easy way for the player to direct where they want to teleport to, not just placing them at the nearest pad. Since the player will need to move their head to push the analogue stick, it changes where they are looking which could throw off which pad they teleport to. The issue with the "gaze" technique for controls is that it is slow and difficult at range, since small movements of the head cause much larger variation in where a raycast is hitting as the point of contact gets farther from the player. I am hoping to develop a system where the player can quickly and easily lock in where they want to move to before executing the teleport.</p>

    Telekinesis with Gaze Controls and Teleportation Failure
  </h2>
  <div class="date">
    2021-03-17
  </div>
  <div class="contents">
    <p>Another week means another new downloadable version of Project Wyvern! You can download the zip file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qIP_O8VQ7EUq9w8oxKKPQiu2q8mDnBbw/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. Continuing where I left off last week it still just has a simple menu and some different spots to interact with mugs. Another big improvement is the reticle I added to the build, a small red sphere that shows exactly where the player is looking. In the videos below it seems that I am only recording the left eye view of the game, so everything looks sightly skewed and the reticle is not centered in the view, I'll make sure to record properly next week.</p>

    <p>This week I worked for a long time on trying to create a gaze controlled teleportation system. I spent my time trying to take the Unity developed teleportation system and tweak it to my needs. The issue I ran into is that the way the events are triggered for teleportation (releasing the thumb stick after pushing it forward) is somehow built in to multiple different files. So, when trying to add an additional way to call the QueueTeleportation function I ended up with multiple errors of functions not agreeing between files. After spending a few days working on this system I decided to save it for next week and try something else.</p>

    <p>The new telekinesis system works much better than my teleportation attempts. The sphere reticle shows where a raycast that is cast from the players eyes is hitting colliders in the scene. So, when the player enables telekinesis mode and looks at a movable object, it will show a red sphere on the object and the object will begin to move closer to the player. Currently the object only remains in telekinesis for 2 seconds since the player last looked at it, so by constantly looking at it they can extend this time.</p>
    <video width="600" height="auto" controls muted>
        <source src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/3_17/pull.mp4" alt="Example of how Tracting/Pull mode is used" type="video/mp4"/>
    </video>

    <p>In addition to a tracting mode, I created the opposite, a push mode. When the player gazes at the middle panel (between the 2 snap turn panels) the reticle will change to green. This means that the player has switched to push telekinesis, and when they look at an object it will instead push it away. The system is essentially just a reversed version of tracting, where the object will move as long as you look at it and has a risidual 2 second time where it continues on its own.</p>

    <video width="600" height="auto" controls muted>
        <source src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/3_17/push.mp4" alt="Example of how Push mode is used" type="video/mp4"/>
    </video>

    <p>Some of the settings are adjustable for telekinesis mode, like how long the object remains in telekinesis and how far it stops from the players face in tracting mode. You can see here how when combined, pushing and tracting mode can be used to move an object around the space.</p>

    <video width="600" height="auto" controls muted>
        <source src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/3_17/pushAndPull.mp4" alt="Example of how modes can be combined" type="video/mp4"/>
    </video>

    <p>My next step with telekinesis will be working on a hold mode, where the player can look at an object and move it around the space by moving their line of sight. I also want to adjust push mode so that it will curve towards where the player is looking. There is also a bug with the telekinesis gaze panel that is stopping its highlight early that I did not have time to address before delivering this build.</p>

    <p>My next week of development is hopefully going to be diving into a way to get a teleportation system working. With my failures from this week I have learned a lot and will hopefully be able to write my own system for moving the player around the game area. I also want to spend time fine tuning the telekinesis so that it is more useful, right now it gives the player the power to move objects but lacks fine tuned control over where they move. I am still considering using the controller as a chin controller for the player, but feel like that isn't as genuine of an effort to change how the game is accessible, it is just a repurposing of existing tools that didn't consider accessibility when created.</p>

    Telekinesis and Reticle Upgrades
  </h2>
  <div class="date">
    2021-03-24 
  </div>
  <div class="contents">
    <p>Welcome to an exciting week of Project Wyvern. You can download the zip file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14D0I7a1aImaNN_86gw6GXL3eaHBUzaFr/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. This week I began by focusing on changing the reticle to include more information for the player. The reticle is no longer just a colored sphere, it is a 2D sprite that shows an image of what telekinesis power the player currently has active. In addition to these icons (which I got from <a href ="https://thenounproject.com/">https://thenounproject.com/</a>) I am planning on adding color changes as well as unique sounds when different powers are active. This way there are multiple indicators to what power the player has active. I also added what I have been calling the "gaze bar", a radial loading bar to show the progress of the players actions.</p>

    <h4>The Gaze Bar</h4>
    <p>The gaze bar gives the players feedback on how close they are to an action triggering. When they stare at the snap turn panels it begins to fill up, surrounding the reticle sprite with a black bar. Once it is full, the action is triggered, turning the player. The same system is used to switching between telekinesis powers and triggering telekinesis powers.</p>

    <h4>New Power: Hold</h4>
    <p>I added a new telekinesis power that allows the player to "hold" objects and move them around the game. This means that they don't push the object away or suck them closer, but can move the object vertically and horizontally. The object is set to maintain the same distance from the player as when the power began, so the distance the object is from the player slightly changes as it gets close to the same height as the players head. I found that this gave the player a bit more control over how the object moved, but also could be annoying.</p>

    <p>While develeping hold I found it annoying that the reticle would not stay in the air where I wanted to move the object, so I adjusted it so that while hold is active, the reticle will constantly follow the players view at the distance the hold object is set to stay from the player. This made it much easier to use and greatly improved my ability to move things around the scene. I also found that it was harder to lift objects starting from the ground vs starting on top of something. I adjusted it so that it would be easier to get an object to the height of the player.</p>

    <p>You can watch the video of me messing around with the different powers below. There are a few bugs throughout, but it does show the potential for the telekinesis system with more time. It also made me feel like Luke Skywalker learning to use the force.</p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDqOwXwCp8g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>Overall I am very proud of this weeks development, I think the hold feature and improved reticle are a huge upgrade to the system that are intuative and accessible to all gamers. With no controller required I still enjoyed expirementing with the tools and think there is a potential for a cool puzzle game which wouldn't require the player to stand, spin, or use a controller.</p>

    <h4>Coming soon!</h4>
    <p>For next week I am planning on adjusting the controls. For the pull, I am planning on changing it so once the gaze bar is full, pull will trigger, and a second bar will fill. However long the player maintains focus as this second bar is filling is how long the item will remain in pull. The same can be down for push. An alternative option is that the player needs to constantly look at the object for pull or push to continue, and when they look away the object will freeze until the gaze bar runs out, then be released from telekinesis.</p>

    <p>Another major adjustment I plan on making is the width of the raycast which can trigger telekinesis. My plan it to point raycast all around the edges of the reticle sprite, so that anything highlighted by the sprite will begin to fill the gaze bar, not just the very center.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I am planning on adjusting how the reticle disappears when looking away from any surface. My current play is to have it remain at the distance from the player it was until they look at another surface, similar when hold telekinesis is active.</p>

    Telekinesis Adjustements, Simple Puzzles, and Bowling??
  </h2>
  <div class="date">
    2021-03-31
  </div>
  <div class="contents">
    <p>Welcome to an exciting week of Project Wyvern. You can download the zip file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yd1NeKicGPzuitNU7smh_ZRDMuRQYBh6/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. I began the week with some adjustments to the telekinesis system as well as working on getting sounds working on movable objects. The rest of the week was spent developing some simple puzzles and games to test out the telekinesis powers. I am hoping to expand upon the game development next week to make some more interesting and compelling puzzles.</p>

    <h4>Telekinesis Changes</h4>
    <p>Instead of using a system where a power you stay active only if you were constantly looking at the object, I changed the telekinesis powers to stay active until the player stared at the object long enough to refill the bar. This was initially confusing because the bar has to fill for the player to activate the power, but by putting a small delay on it I was able to get it working. Now, to activate a telekinesis power a player must stare at an object until the bar fills. To deactivate the power, the player must also stare directly at the object until the bar fills. It makes the telekinesis easier to use and lets the player be much more precise.</p>

    <h4>Adding Sounds</h4>
    <p>With some help from the Unity VR tutorial I was able to add some sounds to objects. You'll notice in the demo below that movable objects make sounds on contact with different surfaces or objects. It is only a small change in sound, but worth noting since it makes the objects feel like they have more weight.</p>

    <h4>Simple Puzzles</h4>
    <p>Currently the game consists of three different puzzles. I started by making something simple so the player could understand the telekinesis on their own. As the puzzles progress the player needs to be more precise with their powers to succeed.</p>

    <p>The first puzzle simply requires the player to drop the red ball into the glass case. This is just an easy introduction to how the telekinesis power works. To activate and deactivate them, the player needs direct eye contact with the object. I am planning on changing this to a maze to better represent this for next week.</p>

        <source src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/4_1/3_1p1.mp4" alt="Intro puzzle!" type="video/mp4"/>
    </video>

    <p>The next puzzle is similar to a childs matching toy. The player has to pick up the smaller objects and match them with the proper pedestal. To move on they need to match all 3 correctly.</p>

        <source src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/4_1/3_1p2.mp4" alt="Correct shape puzzle" type="video/mp4"/>
    </video>

    <p>The final puzzle isn't so much of a puzzle as a game. When trying to think of a good use for the current "push" implementation I realized it would be great for bowling. So, I made myself a little bowling alley to test out my telekinesis! The player has to be much more precise with their object placement to knock down the pins, and also has to use a second telekinesis power to succeed.</p>

        <source src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/4_1/3_1p3.mp4" alt="Bowling!" type="video/mp4"/>
    </video>

    <h4>Coming soon!</h4>
    <p>In this next week I am hoping to add more juice to my game like sounds for different powers, color changing for different powers, more in game sounds, and prettier environments. I also am hoping to improve the reticle, like making it so it does not disappear when looking at the sky. I also recently saw a VR reticle in Star Wars: Squadrons that works similar to mind but remains the same relative size anywhere you look. I'd like to work on scaling up my reticle when it is farther from the player so that it is easier to see.</p>

    <p>I also spent some time this week working on improvements to the "hold" telekinesis power that would allow you to move the object closer and further from you by nodding and shaking your head. I didn't have much success and am planning on returning to that this week.</p>

    <p>Lastly I'd like to adjust the push power to be more of an actual push, and initial shove of power instead of contantly acting on the object, like fus ro dah from Skyrim.</p>

    Refining Telekinesis and Beginning Full Game Dev
  </h2>
  <div class="date">
    2021-04-07 
  </div>
  <div class="contents">
    <p>Welcome to an exciting week of Project Wyvern. You can download the zip file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PRMk9uwcoNwPtlWEC3YU9rmW_ZjfHRnX/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. This week was largely spent trying to develop system to register head shaking and nodding. I also improved the reticle functionality in a few ways, improved the UI appearance, adjusted some telekinesis movements, fixed a number of bugs, and improved the sound in game.</p>

    <h4>Shaking and Nodding</h4>
    <p>My goal and reason for wanting to develop a way to register head shaking and head nodding is that it offers and additional form of input for the player in game. Since the current system is based exclusivly on looking around and staring at objects, more input could dramatically change the game. My first plans with it were to make it so that when nodding your head an object being held in telekinesis would be moved towards you and shaking would move the object away from you. This would have removed the need for the current pull telekinesis power and dramatically increased the amount of control the player has over objects in the scene. Unfortunately I failed to find a way to effectively register head nods and shakes. While what I developed could register them, it is no consistant and sometimes takes 20+ shakes of the head to recognize what the player is trying to do. My big takeaway from this week is that in a game where head movement is the only input players have, requiring a specific form of head movement is difficult to implement and somewhat confusing as a user. You can see my most successful implementation below. I struggled to properly register when the player changes direction of their head movement.</p>

    <img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/4_7/nodCode.PNG" alt="Failed nod and shake code"/>

    <img src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/4_7/nodeCode2.PNG" alt="Failed nod and shake codes"/>

    <h4>Improved Reticle</h4>
    <p>The major change to the reticle this week was the new scaling. Based off of how far the reticle is from the player it's scale increases so that it is easier to see. The trade off is that it covers up more of the environment, but since it is transparent this didn't seem to be too much of an issue. The increase in scale also makes it so that the player can see which power is currently active based off of the icon on the reticle. The icon for the "hold" telekinesis power has also changed to an open hand, and when the power is activated it changes to a closed hand to indicate what mode it is in. This provides the player with a big more feedback about power they currently have active and what is happening in relation to that power. A major bug with the current reticle is that it is clipping into surfaces, making appear less as a UI element and more like a game object. Another large change was the loading bar no longer decreases, it only increases. So as it hits its full capacity it resets to empty and then will begin filling again. This is meant to make the interactions less confusing for the player and make the telekinesis powers easier to use.</p>

    <video width="600" height="auto" controls>
        <source src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/4_7/reticle.mp4" alt="Show reticle scaling, new hand, and loading bar!" type="video/mp4"/>
    </video>

    <h4>Adding Sounds</h4>
    <p>I added sounds to the telekinesis powers to better indicate when they are active and give more feedback to the player when they use them. You can hear them throughout all of the videos, but the clip below UI shows them off well.</p>

    <h4>UI Changes</h4>
    <p>UI in VR is fairly minimal, so in this case I am refering to the snap rotation panels and the power switching panel. Instead of a 3D object I changed the panels to be icons outlined by a black square, with the insides of the square transparent. This helps them appear as a UI element and less like part of the game environment. Additionally, when hold or pull telekinesis are activated, the panels fade so that they are almost completely transparent. This gives the player an indication that they cannot use the panels until they deactivate their current power as well as allows them a better view of the environment if they are trying to move an object behind the panels. You can see an example of this transition in the video. Please excuse me discovering a bug with my colliders staying active on my panels, that will be fixed next week.</p>

        <source src="./assets/projectwyvern/files/4_7/soundAndUI.mp4" alt="Show off UI change and sound" type="video/mp4"/>
    </video>

    <h4>Telekinesis Adjustments</h4>
    <p>The push power has been changed to single powerful push instead of a constant pushing action. This gives the player the feeling that it is more of a powerful and uncontrollable form of telekinesis and less of something that is supposed to be used for refined movement like the hold or pull powers. You can see some examples of it being used in the video below.</p>

    <h4>Coming soon!</h4>
    <p>The next week will be exclusively focused on game development and bug fixes. I am done creating new features and planning on strictly focusing on creating some fun and interesting levels for the player. My plan is to start by storyboarding some ideas and drawing them on paper, and from there I will implement them in editor. I am also hoping to get around the issues I have been having when importing Unity Store Assets where they lose their material properties and all turn pink.</p>

    More Puzzle Development
  </h2>
  <div class="date">
    2021-04-14 
  </div>
  <div class="contents">
    <p>Welcome to the second to last week of Project Wyvern. You can download the zip file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PRMk9uwcoNwPtlWEC3YU9rmW_ZjfHRnX/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. This week was focused on developing more levels for the final deliverable and bug fixes. Most of the bugs were minor things that were simple to fix, like how the panel colliders were not going inactive when the panels fade. A larger bug I discovered was that when a telekinesis power was active for a specific object and you looked at another it immediately switched to controlling the new object! I also improved my object reset to they take a few seconds before they go back to their starting position.</p>

    <h4>Puzzle 4: The Maze</h4>
    <p>While this puzzle is a very simple version of what could be implemented to work with Project Wyvern, it still helps represent the diversity of my research this semester. I created a simple maze that requires the player to lift a small ball (using telekinesis) and navigate the ball to the end. They can't complete the maze without opening 3 gates that are blocking their progress. It currently lacks a lot in juice but sounds and effects will be easy enough to add over the next week.</p>

    <h4>Puzzle 5: Pirate Battle</h4>
    <p>While the pirate battle with Kris is still not finished, it still is fun and cool to show off. The player starts on the deck of their ship to find they have no sails. Using their telekinesis powers the player can lift cannon balls to be placed on rails which will feed them into cannons. Once the balls reach the cannon they fire! Circling the player is the evil bean Captain Kris on their own boat. The current implementation does not have Kris firing their cannons but the final version will. The player needs to hit Kris 3 times with their cannons to finish the level. I felt like this was a fun example of how stationary gameplay could still be interesting and give the player control. I'm planning on adding some side rails where the player can use their push power to try to hit Kris even when their boat is out of range.</p>

    <h4>Last Week!</h4>
    <p>This is my last week of development! I really want to add 1 more puzzle and juice up the games before the showcase. Getting ready for some late nights.</p>

    <p>The final week of Project Wyvern! This last week was focused on juicing up my levels to make the game more interesting and developing some press material to show off the game.</p>

    <h4>This is it!</h4>
    <p>This will most likely be my last dev blog for this game, but hopefully not forever! I am very proud of the game I have developed and hope it can be useful for others to improve accessibility in VR for disabled gamers. My cousin Scott was paralyzed from the neck down for most of his life and was the person who introduced me to gaming. The idea of helping make games more accessible for people like Scott is what inspired me to do this research. If anyone reading this is interested in what I have developed, please don't hesitate to email me at arding@umich.edu! I'd love to pass along any code you might need to get your game started.</p>
