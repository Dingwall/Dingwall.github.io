Hello all!

This week I set out to learn more about what is already being done to push accessibility in gaming forward. I started by looking for research done on the topic.

After reading the abstracts for these articles I chose five to do a deeper dive into. I read through the articles to get a general idea and below have written my major takeaways as a quick summary.


Game Not Over: Accessibility Issues in Video Games

How games are inaccessible for different people, and what important factors play into these issues, such as story, relying on audio cues, lack of tutorial, and overly complex controls

More Than Just a Game: Accessibility in Computer Games

Accessibility is important in gaming to give people access to social outlets, educational tools, and entertainment. Improving accessibility in one of the largest entertainment industries is important to make sure those with disabilities do not feel like they are treated unfairly by society, and giving them equal opportunities.

Game Accessibility and Advocacy for Participation of the Japanese Disability Community

Japan's treatment of video games is not the same as other forms of entertainment. The lack of political efforts to support accessible gaming. Talk about how the issue is gaining traction, especially around the idea of including an easy mode or something similar to make sure the game is accessible.

Design of a Curriculum Framework for Raising Awareness of Game Accessibility

There wasn’t a requirement for accessibility in consoles until 2015. Since this is so recent, most developers have not had the consideration of accessibility included in any part of their education or career experience. Discusses importance of accessibility to unskilled and older gamers.

Using Ants’ Task Division for Better Game Engines – A Contribution to Game Accessibility for Impaired Players

Level problems, or lack of accessibility due to difficulty, are more common than interactive problems. By creating an adaptive game (specifically enemies) based off of player actions/ability, the game becomes more accessible.

After learning more on what research is being done on accessibility in gaming I looked towards what market my research would fall under. This would address a global market and would fall under the art, entertainment, and recreation sectors as it is a video game. It could additionally address the educational sector because of the potential for gaming to be used educationally, and lastly fits under the health care and social assistance sector as it is focused on improving quality of life for those with limiting disabilities. These are massive markets, in the US alone these sectors see around $1.4 billion in annual sales. Globally would be even larger. While this project is focused specifically on those looking for accessibility options in gaming, it still fits into the overall gaming spectrum. There are plently of big players in these markets, but ones that fall in line with my research are large gaming companies.
<ul>
    <li>Ubisoft, worth around 12.8 billion. Ubisoft is a large gaming company with many popular brands like Assassins Creed, Just Dance, Far Cry, Watch Dogs, Tom Clancy Rainbow Six, and many more. They largely develop complex 3D action games.</li>
    <li>EA, worth around 35.1 billion. A massive game development company that covers all the bases, with a dominant control over sports games, but all producing series like Battlefield, The Sims, Plants vs Zombies, current Star Wars games, and many more.</li>
    <li>Nintendo, worth around 57.6 billion. Known across the globe as one of THE video game companies, Nintendo is commonly known as what every mom calls their kids gaming device. Active in the handheld market and focused on developing games for all ages (especially children), Nintendo makes games such as Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Mario, Metroid, and so many more.</li>
    <li>Sony, worth around 105 billion. The owner of the Playstation brand, Sony has exclusives like God of War, Uncharted, the new Spiderman games, Last of Us, and many others.</li>
    <li>Microsoft, worth around 1,770 billion. Microsoft owns Xbox, the main competitor to Playstation. Microsoft has recently been acquiring gaming studies, most likely to guarantee exclusives for their platform, as well as getting into the PC market. They own exclusives such as Halo and Gears of War, and recently acquired Bethesda, the studio who makes games like the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. They have recently made a large push for accessible gaming and released a special controller designed to accommodate all kinds of special tools to make gaming available to everyone.</li>
</ul>
As far as products in my market segment go it should cover all games! Unfortunately not all games make an effort to be accessible. I have found a few games from 2020 that made serious efforts to improve accessibility.
<ul>
    <li>Hyper Dot by Charles McGregor, small game developed with accessibility in mind. Through a research campaign Charles gathered information for what helps make a fun accessible game.</li>
    <li>Last of Us Part II developed my Naughty Dog included over 60 accessibility options to make the game available to all audiences, from colorblind filters to audio to text to auto aim.</li>
    <li>Immortals Fenyx Rising by Ubisoft had many different accessibility features, from difficulty levels to menu narration. The most notable feature was assistance with puzzles in game to make them more accessible.</li>
    <li>Gears Tactics by Microsoft Studios is an RTS, which are well known for their complex details and lengthy lists of stats. They included a “Let the game read to me” mode as well as text to speech functions and larger text to assist players.</li>
    <li>Spider Man: Miles Morales developed by Insomniac Games included a number of accessibility settings to make the game easier to see, and included things like chase assistance to make it easier for players to keep up. They also included a character who communicated with Miles exclusively through sign language, which is important because of the lack of representation in gaming for the disabled community.</li>
</ul>

Lastly I wanted to consider my audience. The audience for this research is those limited by the lack of accessibility in gaming. The idea of accessibility in gaming is growing as the gaming community as a whole grows, becoming one of the largest entertainment industries in the world. The audience ranges from everyday people who can work anywhere and do anything and have difficulty with their vision or hearing, ranging from older people to people with disabilities. It also focuses on those with mental or physical limitations. The audience ranges massively, from people working 40 hour weeks to those who will never be able to work much more than a few hours at a time. They face a number of challenges due to their limitations, and these challenges are often exasperated by society’s lack of effort to make sure products and services are inclusive and accessible. My customers would value fun, accessible, and inclusive gaming that isn’t just designed for small audiences, but enjoyable for everyone. It is unrealistic to expect that my audience will have any resources beyond your average gamer, so the requirement for expensive equipment or custom software is unfair and unrealistic.

Thanks for reading this week! Check back next Thursday for more information
