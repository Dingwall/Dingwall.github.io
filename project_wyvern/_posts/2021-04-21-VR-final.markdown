<p>The final week of Project Wyvern! This last week was focused on juicing up my levels to make the game more interesting and developing some press material to show off the game.</p>

<h4>This is it!</h4>
<p>This will most likely be my last dev blog for this game, but hopefully not forever! I am very proud of the game I have developed and hope it can be useful for others to improve accessibility in VR for disabled gamers. My cousin Scott was paralyzed from the neck down for most of his life and was the person who introduced me to gaming. The idea of helping make games more accessible for people like Scott is what inspired me to do this research. If anyone reading this is interested in what I have developed, please don't hesitate to email me at arding@umich.edu! I'd love to pass along any code you might need to get your game started.</p>
